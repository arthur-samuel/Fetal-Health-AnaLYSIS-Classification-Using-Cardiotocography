Fetal Health Classification Using Cardiotocography Data

Description:
Cardiotocography (CTG) is a valuable tool used during pregnancy to monitor fetal well-being by tracking fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Abnormal CTG readings can indicate potential risks to the pregnancy, necessitating further investigation and possible intervention. In this project, we analyze CTG data to gain insights into fetal health and develop a classification model to ensure the well-being of the fetus.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Analysis: We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the CTG dataset. This includes examining feature distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.

Data Visualization: We utilize various visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize the data and gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable (fetal health).

Model Development: We build a machine learning model to classify fetal health based on CTG features. We use the Random Forest classifier and employ grid search cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the trained model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to assess the model's ability to classify fetal health accurately.

Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to predict fetal health based on new CTG data. The model can be integrated into clinical settings to assist healthcare professionals in assessing fetal well-being and making informed decisions.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of CTG data and develop a reliable model for fetal health classification, contributing to early detection and management of potential risks during pregnancy.
